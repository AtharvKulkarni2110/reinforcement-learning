# reinforcement-learning
This repository will give deep insights into reinforcement learning. This file consists of various environments and their description.
There are mainly 2 types of problems in RL-
1. model-based RL - In this type, the environment is fully observable or MDP is known for the environment(current state fully describes the environment).
2. model-free RL - In this type, MDP is unknown for the environment.

 Before referring main project it's suggested to refer to the other_environments.txt file for a better understanding of different algorithms.
