# Reinforcement Learning Project

This file contains implementations of both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms on different environments such as Frozen Lake and MiniGrid Empty Space. The goal is to explore dynamic programming and model-free control algorithms in these environments.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Frozen Lake Environment using Dynamic Programming

- **Algorithms**:
  - Policy Iteration
  - Value Iteration

- [Environment Documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)
-

  
### Task 2: Model-Free Control Algorithms in MiniGrid Empty Space
- **Algorithms**:
  - Monte Carlo
  - Sarsa
  - Sarsa(λ)
  - Q-Learning
- [Environment Documentation](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/EmptyEnv/)


## Results

- **Frozen Lake**: Dynamic programming algorithms converge quickly on the Frozen Lake environment.
- **MiniGrid**: From the provided graphs, Sarsa(λ) converges faster than Q-learning due to its balance between exploration and exploitation.
