# Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains implementations of both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms in various environments such as **Frozen Lake** and **MiniGrid Empty Space**. The primary goal is to explore dynamic programming and model-free control algorithms in these environments and analyze their performance.

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Frozen Lake Environment using Dynamic Programming

- **Algorithms**:
  - Policy Iteration
  - Value Iteration

- **Environment Documentation**: [Frozen Lake Environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/)

#### **Observation Space**:
Consider a 4x4 map of the Frozen Lake environment. The observation space is discrete, with 16 states representing different grid cells. Each state is labeled with:
  - **S**: Start (usually at 0)
  - **F**: Frozen lake (safe to step on)
  - **H**: Hole (dangerous, the episode ends if the agent steps here)
  - **G**: Goal (successful end of the episode)

By default, the environment looks like this:
```
SFFF
FHFH
FFFH
HFFG
```

Here, each state represents a whole number from 0 to 15. Custom maps can also be defined if needed.

#### **Action Space**:
There are 4 actions the agent can take:
- **0**: Move Left
- **1**: Move Down
- **2**: Move Right
- **3**: Move Up

#### **Rewards**:
- **1**: Reaching the goal
- **0**: Otherwise

### Task 2: Model-Free Control Algorithms in MiniGrid Empty Space

- **Algorithms**:
  - Monte Carlo
  - Sarsa
  - Sarsa(λ)
  - Q-Learning

- **Environment Documentation**: [MiniGrid Empty Space](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/EmptyEnv/)

#### **Observation Space**:
The observation space consists of:
- **Image**: A 7x7 grid centered on the agent, where each grid cell can either represent a part of the environment or the agent itself.
  - Size: `(7,7,3)`, where `3` refers to the RGB channels of the grid cells.
  - Each cell encodes different object types (walls, goal, agent, etc.) and the color intensity of the objects.

- **Direction**: A discrete space where:
  - **0**: Facing Right
  - **1**: Facing Down
  - **2**: Facing Left
  - **3**: Facing Up

- **Mission**: A string describing the agent's goal, e.g., "Get to the green square."

#### **Action Space**:
The actions the agent can take are:
- **0**: Turn Left
- **1**: Turn Right
- **2**: Move Forward



## Results

### **Frozen Lake (Dynamic Programming)**:
- Policy Iteration and Value Iteration algorithms both converge relatively quickly, as the environment is simple and the state space is small (4x4 grid with 16 states).
- These algorithms explore the environment efficiently due to the known model of the environment (model-based RL).

### **MiniGrid Empty Space (Model-Free Control Algorithms)**:
- From the provided graphs, **Sarsa(λ)** converges faster than **Q-learning** due to its ability to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively.
- **Q-learning**, while effective, explores the environment more extensively and takes more steps to converge.
- **Monte Carlo** and **Sarsa** methods both perform well, but Sarsa(λ) shows better convergence under similar hyperparameter settings.
